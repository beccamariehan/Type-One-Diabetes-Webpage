# Informative Type One Diabetes Webpage - Final Project
This is an informative webpage about Type One Diabetes, made to bring insight and understanding of what life is really like living with the chronic condition.

### Objective

Type One Diabetes is often a misunderstood and misrepresented chronic condition with harmful stigmas surrounding it. The goal of this webpage is to teach people more about Type One Diabetes and how it affects those living with it. This will hopefully bring more awareness and better education of the condition.

### What does the webpage entail?

This webpage includes information about what Type One Diabetes is, how one gets it, how one lives with it, how to know the warning signs, and the history of the condition. It is all written with the perspective of the creator of the page (myself), who is a Type One Diabetic. Though this is still a basic page considering all that goes into managing T1D, and there is much more information which could be added, the hope is to shed light on a subject often misunderstood.

### What was used in the building of the webpage?

For this webpage, HTML and CSS were used to create the whole webpage. There are also graphics pulled in from [DesignStripe](https://designstripe.com/). I chose to use only HTML and CSS because I wanted to push myself to learn more about how to design and layout a webpage, and use things such as flexbox and grid. I also want to add a quiz built with JS later to bring in a more instructional aspect.
