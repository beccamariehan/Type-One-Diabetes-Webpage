          <p>Though many people think Type One Diabetes (T1D) is caused by poor eating habits (“You must eat a lot of
            sugar!), T1D is not caused by what one did or did not eat – it is a chronic autoimmune condition. </p>

            id="p2-box-two-img" alt="A cartoonized image of a beta cell being attacked by blue lightning" />
          <p>Because it is an autoimmune condition, this means the body attacks its own immune system, and in the case
            of T1D, its own beta cells which produce insulin in the pancreas.</p>

          <p>Insulin is important to the body because it breaks down the sugars in the body’s bloodstream (blood

          <p>This is the body’s main way of getting energy, so without insulin, it will turn to bodily tissue such as
            muscle and fat stores for that energy, leaving all the sugar in the bloodstream.</p>

      <h3 id="p4-header">What You Should Know About<br> Type One Diabetes</h3>
      <h5 id="p4-header-byline">There is a lot more to living with Type One Diabetes than people know. Knowledge of the
        reality of this condition helps in giving support and bringing awareness to those living with T1D. Here are some
        important things to know about T1D that most people don’t know!</h5>


      <section id="p4-container">

        <section id="p4-circle-one" class="p4-circles">
          <p class="p4-numbers">1</p>
        </section>
        <p id="p4-text-one" class="p4-text">Type One Diabetes is different for every person who has it. There is no one
          size fits all regime, which is what makes it very difficult to manage the condition sometimes.</p>


        <section id="p4-circle-two" class="p4-circles">
          <p class="p4-numbers">2</p>
        </section>
        <p id="p4-text-two" class="p4-text">Don’t be afraid to ask Type One Diabetics about their condition! Most of us
          would LOVE to share our knowledge of T1D with you, and help you understand it better so you can help others
          understand it better as well.</p>

        <section id="p4-circle-three" class="p4-circles">
          <p class="p4-numbers">3</p>
        </section>
        <p id="p4-text-three" class="p4-text">Building off the last point, also be aware and respectful of the questions
          you ask. Some people don’t like talking about their T1D, and some questions or statements can be a little
          offensive. For example, maybe don’t ask a Type One Diabetic if they got T1D because they ate too much sugar.
          Though a valid question, a better question to ask would be “How did you know you had T1D?”. The story will be
          much more interesting and educating anyways!</p>

        <section id="p4-circle-four" class="p4-circles">

        </section>
        <p id="p4-text-four" class="p4-text">Type One Diabetes is a life-long disease, that has no cure currently. It
          cannot be cured through diet and exercise, and it’s going to be something that must be managed 24/7 for the
          rest of a Type One Diabetics life. Offering support in hard times and taking the time to learn about T1D is a
          huge help to Type One Diabetics.</p>

        </section>
        <p id="p4-text-five" class="p4-text">Diabetes burnout is a real thing and can often be serious. Diabetes burnout
          happens when a Type One Diabetic gets “burnt-out” from everything they must manage with T1D. The symptoms of
          burnout can vary, from not maintaining their diabetes as well, to exhaustion, to depression. It’s important to
          watch for these signs in your diabetic friends and reach out and offer help during these times.</p>

        <section id="p4-circle-six" class="p4-circles">
          <p class="p4-numbers">6</p>
        </section>
        <p id="p4-text-six" class="p4-text">Though it seems like watching what you eat is the premise of Type One
          Diabetes, it’s much more complex than that. Counting the number of carbs & sugars in what is eaten is the main
          focus of T1D. Even fats, protein, and fiber sometimes need to be taken into account when calculating the
          correct dosage of insulin a Type One Diabetic needs to take when eating.</p>

        <section id="p4-circle-seven" class="p4-circles">
          <p class="p4-numbers">7</p>
        </section>
        <p id="p4-text-seven" class="p4-text">However, one thing many don’t know is how other factors besides food
          affect blood glucose levels. Stress, exercise, heat/cold, menstrual cycle (for women), hormones, sleep, and
          sickness are all things which can affect blood glucose levels, and again affect each Type One Diabetic
          differently.</p>

        <section id="p4-circle-eight" class="p4-circles">
          <p class="p4-numbers">8</p>
        </section>
        <p id="p4-text-eight" class="p4-text">Often people will comment on how it must be nice Type One Diabetics get to
          eat candy and snacks all the time when their blood sugar is low (hypoglycemic). This isn’t exactly true
          though, because low blood sugars are actually quite stressful, due to the risk of going to low and having more
          serious symptoms such as unconsciousness, seizures, and even death. It more gets tiring to have to eat sugary
          snacks all the time just to keep oneself alive.</p>

        <section id="p4-circle-nine" class="p4-circles">
          <p class="p4-numbers">9</p>
        </section>
        <p id="p4-text-nine" class="p4-text">When do Type One Diabetics use insulin, and when they need to eat
          something? This is more commonly known, but it’s still good to touch on it for those who don’t know. When the
          blood sugar level is high (hyperglycemic), insulin is needed to break down the sugar in the blood stream, so
          this is when insulin would be used. When the blood sugar level is low (hypoglycemic), this is when a snack
          with 15-20 grams of carbs needs to be eaten to bring the blood sugar levels back into a safe range.</p>

        <section id="p4-circle-ten" class="p4-circles">
          <p class="p4-numbers">10</p>
        </section>
        <p id="p4-text-ten" class="p4-text">Many people don’t know the symptoms of a high (hyperglycemic) or low
          (hypoglycemic) blood sugar for Type One Diabetics. When their blood sugar is high, most commonly there are
          symptoms of nausea, headaches, dizziness, exhaustion, and inability to focus. When their blood sugar is low,
          there can also be symptoms nausea, dizziness, inability to focus, exhaustion, along with shakiness, sweating,
          loss of strength, and unconsciousness.</p>

        <section id="p4-circle-eleven" class="p4-circles">

        </section>
        <p id="p4-text-eleven" class="p4-text">Type One Diabetics can manage their condition in many ways, with the help
          of the amazing technology of today. The most common way is through multiple daily injections (MDI), which is
          when one administers their insulin dosages through syringe and needle. There is also the option of an insulin
          pump, which can be used to calculate the dosages needed and regulates the insulin level automatically based on
          its settings. There are blood glucose meters and test strips which test blood sugar levels through a drop of
          blood. Then there are continuous glucose monitors (CGM) which track blood glucose levels in a chart and allow
          Type One Diabetics to know their blood sugar all the time, without pricking their finger every 5 minutes.</p>

      <p id="p4-footer">As you can see, there is much more that goes into managing Type One Diabetes than believed. This
        is just a simplified version of it – there is still much more to T1D! At the end of this webpage are some great
